## Feature plan

### 1. Scoreboard feature - point given scoreboard
This feature will work similar to the leaderboard from [KeepScore](https://keepthescore.co/choose/?ref=landing_top) where 

1. Game created
2. Players of the game entered
3. (optional) Game conditions entered

**Game starts**

4. View of all players where points can be given and deducted from each player
5. Game ends on either "Game conditions" or when the game admin(s) selects to end the game
